# Titanium
A mod that optimizes stuff outside of Minecraft.

### A rewrite is coming this summer (More info at QA below)

## Will make a wiki for config soon [Wiki (beta)](https://github.com/Zacgamingpro1234/Titaniumod/wiki) This Mod Is In WIP

#### High priority on low-end cpu's might make your screen recording's look laggy with a bit of screen tear!

This mod is still in beta soooo maybe crashes? idk Probably not. Will probably stay on only optimizing Windows 10. (Please check the compatibility chart for info).
### THE CUSTOM COMMANDS ARE NOT FULLY TESTED

<summary>QA</summary>

<details>
<summary>Will this rewrite integrate OneConfig?</summary>
Yes, but unfortunately this might slow down development since I have to ask and wait for developers to add certain features.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Will you support 1.16+ and/or fabric/neoforge?</summary>
Probably since OneConfig is currently developing a Modern MC port with these loaders. This also may take some time as it is still in development by PolyFrost.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What features will this rewrite have?</summary>
I have many features planned. Here are a list that I will add, not necessarly on release:    

- PowerPlan Detector & Selector with Ultimate Powerplan option
- An Automatic Priority Setter Just like the current one, but supports all custom launchers
- A custom script that you can upload on github that the user can choose to run on start-up or closing of minecraft
- An OS Detector that allows scripts to not run if the system is not supported.
- A live log viewer inside of Powershell with proper minecraft text/colour formatting.
