<summary>QA</summary>

<details>
<summary>Will this rewrite integrate OneConfig?</summary>
Yes, but unfortunately this might slow down development since I have to ask and wait for developers to add certain features.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Will you support 1.16+ and/or fabric/neoforge?</summary>
Probably since OneConfig is currently developing a Modern MC port with these loaders. This also may take some time as it is still in development by PolyFrost.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What features will this rewrite have?</summary>
I have many features planned. Here are a list that I will add, not necessarly on release:    

- PowerPlan Detector & Selector with Ultimate Powerplan option
- An Automatic Priority Setter Just like the current one, but supports all custom launchers
- A custom script that you can upload on github that the user can choose to run on start-up or closing of minecraft
- An OS Detector that allows scripts to not run if the system is not supported.
- A live log viewer inside of Powershell with proper minecraft text/colour formatting.
